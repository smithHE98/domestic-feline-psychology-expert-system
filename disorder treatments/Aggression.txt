Aggression can be treated depending on the source of the aggression. If the aggression is due to fear, the source of fear might be removed or lessened. If the aggression is due to one's cat not being fixed, it might be best to have the cat fixed. Pain and sickness should be treated under the guidance of a veterinarian. Ensure that the cat has enough space to roam, toys to play with, food to eat, etc.
