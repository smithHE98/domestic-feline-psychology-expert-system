The cure for this behavior is to determine the source of the stress and to remove it, if possible. In multi-cat households, the interactions between cats can be a source of stress, so look for aggressive behavior between the cats and note how the over-grooming cat is reacting to the others. The troubled cat may need his own space away from the others, at least for part of the day, a time-out if you will. Some cats are sound-sensitive and should be provided with quiet areas in the house. 

The cat’s caregiver(s) can actually be the cause of the anxiety that leads to displacement behavior and if the anxiety continues, to stereotypic or compulsive behavior. If one's behavior toward the cat is inconsistent and confusing, the cat may experience “approach-avoidance conflict”.
