Frustration arises when a cat is unable to complete a behavior due to physical or psychological obstacles. When cats are frustrated--such as a cat that cannot gain access to an outdoor cat that it sees through the window--they can exhibit redirected behavior (eg, attack of another family pet or owner), a displacement behavior, or signs associated with anxiety. Another example of goal frustration is a cat that chases a laser light toy but cannot catch it. This frustration may lead to obsessive chasing of other lights and shadows.
