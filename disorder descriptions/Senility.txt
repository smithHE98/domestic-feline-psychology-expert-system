One such issue associated with aging is a decline in cognitive abilities (eg, learning, memory, attention, spatial abilities) as a result of ageing changes in the brain. This is sometimes referred to as senility (being senile), or dementia, as in humans, but is more correctly termed cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS).
