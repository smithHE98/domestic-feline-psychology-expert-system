While it’s true that cats love to sleep, many experience restlessness at night. These cats wake in the middle of the night and roam around the house, play with toys, look for food, or try to rouse you. This behavior is often attributed to the cat’s nocturnal nature, and most cats do wake at least a couple of times a night. However some cats wake more often than that, and for extended periods of time. This problem can also carry over into the day, and you end up with a cat who isn’t getting rest day or night.
