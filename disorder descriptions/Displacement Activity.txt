Displacement activity is the resolution of a conflict by performing a seemingly unrelated activity. When a cat is unable to physically or behaviorally perform an appropriate activity, it will often perform an apparently irrelevant activity. Displacement behaviors may arise from conflict or frustration or be a vacuum activity. For example, a cat that is obviously in conflict between sex and aggression or between aggression and fear can react with irrelevant activities, such as grooming, feeding, or sleeping.
